        <h1>The Evolution of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)</h1>
        
        <h2>Early Days: Pre-RHEL Era</h2>
        <p>
            Before the emergence of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), enterprise Linux operating systems were fragmented, lacking a unified, standardized solution. This period was marked by the absence of a comprehensive enterprise-grade Linux distribution.

        <h2>2000: Birth of Red Hat Enterprise Linux</h2>
        <p>
            In the year 2000, Red Hat introduced Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), revolutionizing the enterprise Linux landscape. RHEL brought forth a subscription-based, enterprise-grade Linux OS that offered stability, support, and a standardized platform for businesses.
